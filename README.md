## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment tool (recommended)
- Docker (for containerized projects)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ezekielamitchell/Robotics.git
cd Robotics
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Start

#### OpenCV Learning Lab
```bash
cd Lab/OpenCV_Robotics
pip install -r requirements.txt
python camera.py  # Test camera setup
```

#### ResponsiveArm Control
```bash
cd Projects/ResponsiveArm.pi
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Keep hardware-specific code modular and well-documented
- Use type hints and docstrings for all functions
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Write unit tests for critical functionality

### Safety and Security
- Always implement emergency stop mechanisms for physical systems
- Validate all sensor inputs before actuation
- Log all system operations for audit trails
- Follow defense/military security protocols for sensitive applications
- Never commit credentials or sensitive configuration data

### Testing
- Test hardware interfaces with simulated inputs first
- Gradually increase actuation speeds during testing
- Always have manual override capabilities
- Document all failure modes and recovery procedures

## Hardware Safety

### General Safety Guidelines
1. **Power Management**: Always use properly rated power supplies
2. **Mechanical Safety**: Ensure adequate workspace clearance
3. **Thermal Management**: Monitor component temperatures during operation
4. **Emergency Stops**: Implement and test emergency shutdown procedures
5. **Supervision**: Never leave autonomous systems unattended during development

### Defense Applications
- Comply with all applicable regulations (ITAR, EAR, etc.)
- Implement secure communication protocols
- Maintain audit logs for all system operations
- Follow organizational security policies
- Report any security incidents immediately
