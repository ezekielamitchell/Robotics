# Safety Guidelines for Robotics Systems

This document outlines essential safety guidelines for developing, testing, and deploying robotic systems in this repository.

## General Safety Principles

### 1. Risk Assessment

Before operating any robotic system:
- Identify potential hazards (mechanical, electrical, software)
- Assess risk severity and likelihood
- Implement appropriate mitigation measures
- Document all risks and mitigations

### 2. Safe Design Practices

- **Fail-Safe Mechanisms**: Systems should fail to a safe state
- **Emergency Stops**: All systems must have accessible emergency stop
- **Power Management**: Use proper fuses and circuit protection
- **Mechanical Limits**: Implement both software and hardware limits
- **Redundancy**: Critical safety systems should have backups

### 3. Testing Protocols

- Start with minimal power/speeds
- Test in controlled environments
- Incremental testing approach
- Document all test results
- Review failures and near-misses

## Hardware Safety

### Electrical Safety

**Power Systems:**
- Use properly rated power supplies
- Implement overcurrent protection
- Ensure proper grounding
- Insulate all exposed conductors
- Label voltage levels clearly

**Battery Safety:**
- Use appropriate battery chemistry for application
- Implement battery management systems
- Monitor temperature during charging
- Store batteries safely
- Dispose of batteries properly

### Mechanical Safety

**Moving Parts:**
- Provide adequate clearance zones
- Use guards where appropriate
- Implement soft stops and limits
- Monitor for excessive forces
- Regular maintenance and inspection

**Servo Motors:**
- Verify torque limits are appropriate
- Test under load conditions
- Monitor for overheating
- Secure all mounting points
- Check for mechanical wear

### Thermal Management

- Monitor component temperatures
- Provide adequate ventilation
- Use heat sinks where needed
- Implement thermal shutdown
- Avoid operation in extreme temperatures

## Software Safety

### Safe Coding Practices

```python
# Example: Safe servo control with validation
def set_servo_angle(channel: int, angle: float) -> bool:
    """
    Safely set servo angle with validation.
    
    Returns True if successful, False otherwise.
    """
    # Validate inputs
    if not (0 <= channel < 16):
        logger.error(f"Invalid servo channel: {channel}")
        return False
    
    if not (MIN_ANGLE <= angle <= MAX_ANGLE):
        logger.error(f"Angle {angle} out of safe range [{MIN_ANGLE}, {MAX_ANGLE}]")
        return False
    
    try:
        # Set angle with error handling
        pca.servo[channel].angle = angle
        logger.info(f"Servo {channel} set to {angle} degrees")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to set servo {channel}: {e}")
        # Emergency stop
        emergency_stop()
        return False
```

### Critical Safety Features

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate sensor inputs and commands
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of all error conditions
3. **Watchdog Timers**: Detect and recover from software hangs
4. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for post-incident analysis
5. **Safe Defaults**: Systems start in safe, known states

### Emergency Stop Implementation

```python
def emergency_stop():
    """Emergency stop all actuators immediately."""
    logger.critical("EMERGENCY STOP ACTIVATED")
    
    # Disable all servos
    for channel in range(16):
        try:
            pca.servo[channel].angle = None
        except:
            pass
    
    # Set emergency flag
    global EMERGENCY_STOP_ACTIVE
    EMERGENCY_STOP_ACTIVE = True
    
    # Notify operators
    send_alert("EMERGENCY_STOP", "All systems halted")
```

## Operational Safety

### Pre-Operation Checklist

Before operating any robotic system:
